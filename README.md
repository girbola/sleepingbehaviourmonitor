# Sleeping Behaviour Monitor
This was my final project of Programming Engineering Project with Wapice IoT Ticket.
We did not get Raspberry Pi on time to read real-time temperature and illumination sensors.
I created simulation for Raspberry Pi and possible user who has to wake up every 1 hours
to toilet and comes back after 10 minutes. Data will be collected every second but
only sending to Wapice Iot Ticket in every 2 hours because there are not an actual device
to test with.
