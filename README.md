# Sleeping Behaviour Monitor
This was my final project of Programming Engineering Project with Wapice IoT Ticket.

### Rasberry Pi - sensors
We didn't get Raspberry Pi on time to read real-time temperature and illumination sensors.
I created simulation for Raspberry Pi and possible user who will wake up every 1 hour
to toilet and comes back after 10 minutes.

### Wapice IoT
Data will be collected every second but only sending all collected data to Wapice Iot Ticket every 2
hours.
